; Assorted utilities for working with sections.
;
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
; OVERVIEW
; --------
; Recall what a section looks like:
;
;     Section
;         Atom "foo" ; usually a node of some kind.
;         ConnectorSeq
;             Connector
;                Atom "bar" ; for example, a WordNode.
;                DirNode "+" ; Some edge label.
;             Connector
;                ....
;
; It should be thought of as being shaped like a spider, with a body
; at the center, and a bunch of legs. In the above, the body is the
; atom "foo", and "bar" is one of the legs.  Or rather, "bar" is at
; the end of one of the legs, so that foo-bar can be though of as an
; edge connecting two vertexes. Its a labelled edge - the
; DirNode is the label.  Formally, the body is called the "germ".
;
; The utilities provide various ways of accessing different parts of
; the section, given one of the atoms in a section. So, for example:
; given a germ, find the various parts of sections:
;
; get-germ-connector-seqs - given the germ, return a list of all
;      ConnectorSeq's appearing in sections on the germ.  The
;      connector sequences are in one-to-one correspondance with
;      the sections on the germ.
;
; get-germ-connectors     - given the germ, return a list of all
;      Connectors that appear in seme section on the germ.
;
; get-germ-endpoints      - given the germ, return a list of all
;      endpoints (legs or vertexes) on all sections having that germ.
;      The endpoint is defined as the first atom in the connector.
;
; Conversely, given one of the other parts, find the germs:
;
; get-conseq-germs        - given a connector sequence, return all
;       germs that have this connector sequence in thier section.
;       There is one connector sequence per section.
;
; NOTES:
; ------
; This is currently implemented in just plain-old scheme, and should
; be fine for general use. However, performance could be much improved
; by re-implementing these in C++. Basically, these just do a lot of
; very simple atom access, and thus the overhead of guile is
; proportionatly greater.
