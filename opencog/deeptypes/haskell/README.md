# Attempts to use Haskell type checker for deep type checking

This folder contains one or more Haskell files to experiment with deep
type checking, as firstly described in
https://github.com/opencog/opencog/issues/1311 and
http://wiki.opencog.org/w/Deep_types

## Experiment with 'data'

```
experiment_with_data.hs
```

is a proposal using the Haskell type construct 'data'.

You may load it in the Haskell interpreter

```
ghci experiment_with_data.hs
```

and check the types of h1, h2 and h3

```
*Main> :t h1
h1 :: Concept
*Main> :t h2
h2 :: Predicate
*Main> :t h3
h3 :: TV
*Main> :t h4
h4 :: SchemaLink
```

It's able to acheive something but it's very verbose. The atom
hierarchy is captured in the atoms constructors, like AConcept to tell
an Atom can be a Concept, etc. Could perhaps work, but it's really not
elegant.

The hierarchy is rather limited as well, for instance I can't define a
SchemaLink of type (Number, Number) -> Number, for that I'd have to
define another SchemaLink constructor specially for that
signature.

## Experiment with GADT

GADT https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GADT provides a richer data
type structure allowing to declare the type of the data constructors.

You may load it in the Haskell interpreter

```
ghci experiment_with_GADT.hs
```

and check the types of a few constructs

```
*Main> :t h1
h1 :: Atom String
*Main> :t h2
h2 :: Atom (Atom b -> TV)
*Main> :t tv3
tv3 :: Atom TV
*Main> :t h4
h4 :: Atom (Atom [Atom Float] -> Atom Float)
*Main> :t h5
h5 :: Atom Float
```
