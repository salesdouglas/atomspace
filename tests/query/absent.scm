; Unit testing for absence of a single term.
;
; Repeatedly create and destroy an EvaluationLink. Then test to see if the
; EvaluationLink is present in the atomspace. If it is, then set a state
; atom that indicates whether it is present or not.
;
; The state atom is called "Room List", and it will be linked either to
; (ConceptNode "empty") or to (ConceptNode "full"). The (show-room-state)
; function will display the current state, when called.
;
; The room state is set by invoking two patterns: is-visible and
; is-invisibile.  The first checks for the presence of the EvaluationLink
; and, if found, sets the room state to full.  The second checks for it's
; absense, and if it is absent, sets the state to "empty".
;
; The EvaluationLink is created and destroyed by running one of two
; patterns, `create` or `destroy`.
