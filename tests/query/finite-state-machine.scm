;;; To define two or more machines that run at the same time, each
;;; should use a different AnchorNode, so that the states of the
;;; various machines would not get confused with one-another.
;;; It would also probably be a good idea to include the machine name
;;; (i.e. the AnchorNode) as part of the transition rules, so that
;;; the transition rules for one machine would not get used accidentally
;;; for another machine.
